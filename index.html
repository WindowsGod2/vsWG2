            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Vs. WindowsGod2 is a Friday Night Funkin' mod created by WindowsGod2 to add lore to his OC with the same name. He figured that if he made his own mod for the game that he would gain some more popularity.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 20px; font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; border-style: outset;"><b>The first instance of this mod being worked on was on October 7th, 2021, when the first track was made for it. Though, at the time, the mod was not a final decision and was made for fun. Another track would be made on October 19th, 2021.<br>
                On November 2nd, 2021, a storyline for the possible mod about WindowsGod2 was made. It would have five weeks centered around the idea of depression, and visualizing it with inspiration from We've Destroyed All The Hope In This World. Three days later on November 5th, 2021, two game over tracks were made. Two days after that, another main track would be made.<br>
                Between the days of November 20th, 2021 and February 7th, 2022, five new tracks would be made for the mod. One of those being Reminiscence on December 16th, 2021, the earliest track to be made that currently appears in the mod.<br>
                On February 11th, 2022, the discord server for the mod would be created, officially making this mod a reality. From this point forward until March 10th, 2023, the mod would undergo production and hiatuses. Finally, on March 10th, 2023, the official demo of the mod was released on GameBanana, along with its official soundtrack. Between the mod's official birth and demo release, forty two tracks were made, signifying there will be a lot of content in the upcoming updates.<br>
                On May 11th, 2024, a minor update to the mod was released as "Demo 1.01" where some assets were changed. On May 20th, 2024, a second minor, a second minor update would be released. This new update updates Psych Engine 0.7.3, adds new Geometry Dash assets, and Dialogue to the first and only week of the demo.</b></p>
