            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Vs. WindowsGod2 is a Friday Night Funkin' mod created by WindowsGod2 to add lore to his OC, Windo. He figured he would gain more popularity if he made his mod for the game.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 20px; font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; border-style: outset;"><b>The first instance of this mod being worked on was on October 7th, 2021, when the first track was made for it. Though, at the time, the mod was not a final decision and was made for fun. Another track was made on October 19th, 2021.<br>
                    On November 2nd, 2021, a storyline for the possible mod about Windo was made. It would have five weeks centered around the idea of depression, and visualizing it with inspiration from We've Destroyed All The Hope In This World. Three days later on November 5th, 2021, two game over tracks were made. Two days after that, another main track would be made.<br>
                    Five new tracks were made for the mod between November 20th, 2021, and February 7th, 2022. One of those is Reminiscence on December 16th, 2021, the earliest track to be made that currently appears in the mod.<br>
                    On February 11th, 2022, the discord server for the mod would be created, officially making this mod a reality. From this point forward until March 10th, 2023, the mod would undergo production and hiatuses. Finally, on March 10th, 2023, the official demo of the mod was released on GameBanana, along with its official soundtrack. Between the mod's official conception and demo release, forty-two tracks were made, signifying there will be a lot of content in the upcoming updates.</b>

        <h2><u>Character Information</u></h2>
        <h3>Windo</h3>
        <h4>Appearance</h4>
        <p>Windo is the main character of the mod. He's depicted as the 111th cube icon in Geometry Dash, composed of crimson, violet, and navy blue.<br>
        He has two white circles for eyes and a white mouth that changes in shape depending on his expression.<br>
        His origins are unknown, but he was first discovered in a container of green fluid and released by accident in January 2012.</p>
        <h4>Personality</h4>
        <p>Windo is rather energetic and outgoing. Generally, he's friendly and spunky and a bit of a "tsundere" when put in embarrassing situations that can fluster him. He claims not to enjoy physical affection, but this is false.<br>
        He is completely aroace, and feels dissatisfaction in romantic situations to the extent that he will not hesitate to act violently in such conditions. This can include verbal, mental, or physical violence.</p>
